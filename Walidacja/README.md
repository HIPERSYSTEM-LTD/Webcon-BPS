# Walidacja (Validation Patterns)

This section contains reusable technical patterns related to **data validation** in Webcon BPS.

Validation patterns help ensure data correctness, consistency, and business rule enforcement at the form and workflow level.

## 📌 Scope

The examples in this category focus on:

- Conditional required fields  
- Cross-field validation  
- Format validation (e.g., numbers, text patterns)  
- Logical constraints between attributes  
- Preventing incorrect form submission  

All patterns are based on **generic technical mechanisms**, not business-specific logic.

## 🧩 Typical Techniques Used

- Form rules  
- Attribute-based conditions  
- Expression logic  
- Validation actions in workflow steps

## 🎯 Goal of These Patterns

These examples demonstrate how to:

- Reduce user input errors  
- Improve data quality  
- Enforce consistent system behavior  
- Guide users during form completion
